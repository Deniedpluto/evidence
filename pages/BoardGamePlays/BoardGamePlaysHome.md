Back in January of 2016, I made it a goal of mine to track every board game I played. It all started with a simple Excel file where I would log all the key information including who played, what game, the date, who won, and what the final scores were. Ultimately using Excel for this was too cumbersome and I moved over to the [BGStats](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/) and now, nearly 800 games later, I am still going strong.
