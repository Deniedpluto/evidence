## My Data World

As a certified nerd, I love to collect data and mine it for insights. Over the years, I have collected data across many personal projects and now I am taking my first steps to bring the display of it all into a single place. Below you will find a list of my current data projects. There are a few that haven't been pulled together yet, but hopefully we will have them all live before the end of Q1 2025.

- [Board Game Plays](BoardGamePlays/BoardGamePlaysHome)
- [Espresso Shot Analysis](Espresso/EspressoData)
- [MTG Commander Analysis](Commander/CommanderHome/)
- *Board Game Recommendation Engine*
- *Board Game Geek Analysis*

## Overview of the data

### Board Game Plays

The board game plays data comes from the [BGStats app](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/). This is exported from the app as a json file and then parsed into (mostly) normalized tables in parquet format then loaded into Motherduck. The code and file can be found on my [Board Game Plays github](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/BoardGamePlays).

### Espresso Shot Analysis

The espresso shot data is collected in a Google Form which loads the data into a Google Sheet. The data from the Google Sheet is loaded into Motherduck via github actions and refreshed nightly. You can see the [github action code](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/motherduck_data_update) in my repo.

### MTG Commander Analysis

The MTG Commander Analysis data comes from two files csv files generated by a series of R Scripts that update the deck Elo, win rate against, and the decks *strength*. These files are currently not in Motherduck, but the plan is to replace the R Script with an app that will load the data into Motherduck. The code can be found in my [MTG Battle Logger](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/MTG-Battle-Logger) repo.
