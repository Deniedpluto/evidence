## My Data World

As a certified nerd, I love to collect data and mine it for insights. Over the years, I have collected data across many personal projects and now I am taking my first steps to bring the display of it all into a single place. Below you will find a list of my current data projects. There are a few that haven't been pulled together yet, but hopefully we will have them all live before the end of Q1 2025.

- [Board Game Plays](BoardGamePlays/BoardGamePlaysHome)
- [Espresso Shot Analysis](Espresso/EspressoData)
- [MTG Commander Analysis](Commander/CommanderHome/)
- *Board Game Recommendation Engine*
- *Board Game Geek Analysis*
