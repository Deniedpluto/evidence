## My Data World

As a certified nerd, I love to collect data and mine it for insights. Over the years, I have collected data across many personal projects and now I am taking my first steps to bring the display of it all into a single place. Below you will find a list of my current data projects. There are a few that haven't been pulled together yet, but hopefully we will have them all live before the end of Q1 2025.

- [Board Game Plays](BoardGamePlays/BoardGamePlaysHome)
- [Espresso Shot Analysis](Espresso/EspressoData)
- [MTG Commander Analysis](Commander/CommanderHome)
- [Custom MTG D&D Set](https://deniedpluto.github.io)
- *Board Game Recommendation Engine*
- [Board Game Geek Analysis](BGGDashboard/BGGDashboard)

## Overview of the data

### Board Game Plays
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/BoardGamePlays)

The board game plays data comes from the [BGStats app](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/). This is exported from the app as a json file and then parsed into (mostly) normalized tables in parquet format then loaded into Motherduck.

### Espresso Shot Analysis
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/motherduck_data_update)

The espresso shot data is collected in a Google Form which loads the data into a Google Sheet. The data from the Google Sheet is loaded into Motherduck via github actions and refreshed nightly. 

### MTG Commander Analysis
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/MTG-Battle-Logger)

The MTG Commander Analysis data comes from two csv files, CommnaderDecksWRA.csv and CommanderHistory.csv, generated by a series of R Scripts that update the deck Elo, win rate against, and the decks *strength*. These files are currently not in Motherduck, but the plan is to replace the R Script with an app that will load the data into Motherduck. Deck Tags is a Google Sheet that is manually filled out and loaded into Motherduck.

### Custom MTG D&D Set
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/deniedpluto.github.io)

The Custom MTG D&D Set is a set of cards that I have created based on the D&D Campaigns I have run since starting to DM back in 2017. The cards were created using [Magic Set Editor](https://magicseteditor.boards.net/) then exported to images and text files. A python script preps and loads the data to GitHub Pages.

### Board Game Recommendation Engine
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/BGG_Recommender)

I built this recommendation engine a few years ago as an extension of work I had been doing using cosine similarity. I built an R Shiny app that allowed an end user to input a users boardgamegeek (BGG) username and pull their collection and rating information down. I then used this app to create a small database of some of the top contributors to BGG and their collections. I then used this database to create a recommendation engine that would take a user's collection and find similar users and recommend games that those users had rated highly. The app is currently not live, but the code is available in the repo. I plan on moving the data into MotherDuck and rebuilding the app to use that as the data source. A secondary app will need to be built to collect new usernames to add to the database.

### Board Game Geek Analysis
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/bgg-dashboard)

The origins of this dahboard go all the way back to 2019 when I built it in PowerBI as part of an onboarding project at Decisive Data. The goal was to test the implementation of pulling data directly from an API into PowerBI. Since the original design it has been expanded multiple times and I have replaced the live connection to the BGG API with a static data source due to additional restrictions being added to the API itself. The current refresh process is manual, though it could be scheduled.
