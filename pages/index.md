## My Data World

As a certified nerd, I love to collect data and mine it for insights. Over the years, I have collected data across many personal projects and now I am taking my first steps to bring the display of it all into a single place. Below you will find a list of my current data projects. There are a few that haven't been pulled together yet, but hopefully we will have them all live before the end of Q1 2025.

- [Board Game Plays](BoardGamePlays/BoardGamePlaysHome)
- [Espresso Shot Analysis](Espresso/EspressoData)
- [MTG Commander Analysis](Commander/CommanderHome)
- [Custom MTG D&D Set](https://deniedpluto.github.io)
- *Board Game Recommendation Engine*
- [Board Game Geek Analysis](BGGDashboard/BGGDashboard)

## Overview of the data

### Board Game Plays
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/BoardGamePlays)

The board game plays data comes from the [BGStats app](https://www.bgstatsapp.com/). This is exported from the app as a json file and then parsed into (mostly) normalized tables in parquet format then loaded into Motherduck.

### Espresso Shot Analysis
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/motherduck_data_update)

The espresso shot data is collected in a Google Form which loads the data into a Google Sheet. The data from the Google Sheet is loaded into Motherduck via github actions and refreshed nightly. 

### MTG Commander Analysis
[Repo](https://github.com/Deniedpluto/MTG-Battle-Logger)

The MTG Commander Analysis data comes from two csv files, CommnaderDecksWRA.csv and CommanderHistory.csv, generated by a series of R Scripts that update the deck Elo, win rate against, and the decks *strength*. These files are currently not in Motherduck, but the plan is to replace the R Script with an app that will load the data into Motherduck. Deck Tags is a Google Sheet that is manually filled out and loaded into Motherduck.
